# CGAN Image Colorizer
 Developed by me to colorize black and white images automatically

## Overview
I will keep this short as I have spend enough time on this project. Basically the final_gan notebook contains the most up to date code. The original convnet should be able to run, although the results will suck. The other original GAN doesn't work, I left it in to show the development process for anyone who was wondering. The data loader originally processed the images into a separate folder, but the final notebook doesn't use it. However, it may prove to be useful for anyone looking to create new datasets based off of an original folder of images.
